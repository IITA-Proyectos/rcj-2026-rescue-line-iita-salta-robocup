# Test Document

This file was created automatically to verify that the translation workflow is functioning correctly.

## Robot Details

Our robot uses a **Teensy 4.1** for motor and sensor control, and a **Raspberry Pi 4B** for computer vision with YOLOv8.

### Communication

Communication between both processors is done via serial port at 115200 baud, using a binary protocol with synchronization bytes.

## Objective

If this file appears translated in `docs/en/test-traduccion.md`, the workflow is working correctly. 🎉
