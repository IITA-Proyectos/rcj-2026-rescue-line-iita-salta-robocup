# Reference Study: Top Team Approaches in RoboCupJunior Rescue Line (2024–2025) and Key Readings of Rules 2025

**Creation Date:** 2026-02-23 (America/Argentina/Salta)  
**Created by:** ChatGPT 5.2 (GPT-5.2 Pro) at the request of **Gustavo Viollaz**  
**Purpose:** Technical **reference document** for robot design, scoring strategy, and assembly of the TDP/Poster/Video in Rescue Line.  
**Suggested location in the repo:** `docs/en/reference-top-teams-rescue-line-2024-2025.md`  
**Scope:** Navigation, traction, and mechanics for ramps/seesaw, line and green detection, evacuation zone, victim search and classification, sensors, power, communication in SuperTeam, and scoring strategies (rules 2025).

---

## 0) Transparency and Methodology (to avoid inventing)

RoboCupJunior does not require that the TDP of all teams be public on the internet. In practice, **many winning TDPs are not publicly accessible** (or are behind event platforms).

To keep this document 100% verifiable, the analysis is based on open and traceable sources:

1) **Official results** (to identify winners 2024 and 2025).  
2) **Official RCJ Rescue Line 2025 regulations (final)** (for numbers, restrictions, and scoring).  
3) **Public technical documentation from high-performance teams**, including:
   - **Overengineering²** (world champion 2024; public and very detailed repository).
   - **Airborne** (2025 team with extremely complete public documentation —not necessarily a champion— but useful as “engineering reference + documentation,” because it publishes architecture, components, and approach).

> If your goal is to compare exactly with the TDP of the 2025 champion (“Danesh”), you need access to the TDP (if it exists) via the event organization or the team. This document includes “champion level” reference practices based on what is public.

## 2) What the track “requires”: numbers that must guide design (Rules 2025)

This summary is not for memorization: it is for designing against the reality of the field.

### 2.1 Line and tiles
- Tiles: **30×30 cm**
- Black line: **1–2 cm** wide
- There may be “joints” between tiles of up to **3 mm**

### 2.2 Gaps
- Before a gap, there is **≥ 5 cm** of black line.
- Length of gap: **≤ 20 cm**

### 2.3 Green markers (intersections)
- Greens: **25×25 mm**
- No green: go straight
- “Dead end”: two greens (one on each side) → robot must turn **180°**

### 2.4 Obstacles, bumps, debris
- Speed bump: height **≤ 1 cm**
- Debris: height **≤ 3 mm**, loose (not fixed)
- Obstacle: at least **15 cm** high

### 2.5 Ramps and seesaw (the part that most defines mechanics)
- Ramps: inclination **≤ 25°**; can be multi-tile.
- Seesaw: inclination **< 20°**, straight line.

### 2.6 Evacuation Zone (EZ)
- Dimensions: **120×90 cm**, with walls around (≥ 10 cm)
- EZ entrance: **silver reflective tape 25×250 mm**
- EZ exit: **black tape 25×250 mm**
- Victims: spheres of **4–5 cm**, weight up to **80 g**
  - “Alive”: **silver**, reflective and **conductive**
  - “Dead”: **black**, non-conductive
  - Total: **2 alive + 1 dead**

## 3) Scoring 2025: how to win (and how to lose) without realizing it

In 2025, winning is not just “moving”: it is **moving + documenting + solving technical challenges**.

### 3.1 Field points (useful summary)
- Tiles between checkpoints:  
  - 1st attempt: **5 pts/tile**  
  - 2nd attempt: **3 pts/tile**  
  - 3rd attempt: **1 pt/tile**  
  - >3: **0**  
- Hazards per tile: gaps (10), bumps (10), intersections (10), ramp (10 per inclined tile), obstacle (20), seesaw (20).

**Translation:** consistency > speed. Avoiding retries and LOP gives more points than running.

### 3.2 Multipliers for rescues (SVR)
- Each alive rescued: multiplier **×1.4**.
- The dead adds **×1.4** only if the 2 alive have already been evacuated.
- Each Lack of Progress in the run with EZ cuts the multiplier: **0.05 × LOP** is subtracted (with a minimum of 1.25).

**Strategic reading:** entering the EZ without a robust plan is the shortest path to losing multipliers.

### 3.3 Weight of documentation and technical challenge
Total score =  
- 0.6 field + 0.2 rubrics + 0.2 technical challenge (normalized).  
Rubrics = 0.6 TDP + 0.2 video + 0.2 poster.

**Reading:** an excellent robot can lose to one “just slightly inferior” but with impeccable documentation.

## 4) “Champion pattern” architecture 2024–2025

Analyzing Overengineering² (champion 2024) and Airborne (2025 team with complete public docs) reveals a common pattern:

1) **Vision as the main sensor** (line + green + objects/areas).  
2) **Strong compute + acceleration** (e.g., Coral TPU) for real-time inference.  
3) **Distributed architecture**: SBC (Pi) for perception/decision + microcontroller for deterministic control.  
4) **4WD + soft wheels + compliance** (suspension or chassis that “forgives” the terrain).  
5) **Observability**: telemetry, GUI, or web interface for quick calibration.

### 4.1 Overengineering² (champion 2024): “vision-first” + debug ecosystem
In their public repo, they report:
- Raspberry Pi (in recent iterations they mention Pi 5) + **Coral USB Accelerator**.
- Main program in Python with **OpenCV + NumPy**, using **multiprocessing**.
- GUI to monitor cameras/sensors live.
- Use of IMU (they mention BNO055), and a significant number of IR sensors.
- Dedicated LED lighting to stabilize vision.

### 4.2 Airborne (2025, exemplary public docs): dual-processor + YOLOv8 + massive ToF
In their public documentation, they report:
- Raspberry Pi 5 + Raspberry Pi Pico + Coral USB.
- 2 YOLOv8 models: victims and detection of the silver strip entering the EZ.
- **5× VL53L0X (ToF)** + I2C mux, plus IMU.
- 4× 12V DC motors (77 RPM), silicone wheels, passive suspension.
- Dedicated buck regulators, custom PCBs, Websocket/HTML interface for debug.

## 5) Navigation (following the line): real approaches and trade-offs

### 5.1 Approach 1: Camera + classical vision (OpenCV)
**What it does:** line segmentation (black/white), lateral error/angle calculation, PID control.

**Why it works at the top level:**
- A camera can see *much more* than a point sensor: curves, intersections, gaps, and context.
- With a well-chosen ROI, control is stable and fast.

**Where it fails if you are not careful:**
- Variable lighting: shadows, reflections, warm/cool light.
- Motion blur and rolling shutter.

**Typical mitigations from strong teams:**
- Own lighting (LED) + exposure/balance control.
- GUI/quick on-site calibration (HSV sliders / thresholds).
- Logging (FPS, latency, error rate).

Real implementation reference (champion 2024): Overengineering² uses OpenCV/NumPy and multiprocessing.  
Source: https://github.com/Overengineering-squared/Overengineering-squared-RoboCup

### 5.2 Approach 2: IR reflectance array (classic)
**What it does:** 8–16 sensors on the floor, estimates line position by weighting, PID on error.

**Advantages:**
- Very low latency.
- Very easy to debug and tune.

**Disadvantages:**
- Green (25×25 mm) becomes a separate problem.
- On ramps/seesaw, the sensor-floor distance changes → reading distorts.
- In gaps (up to 20 cm), you need an extra strategy (IMU/encoders/vision).

**When to choose it:**
- If the team wants maximum simplicity and stability.
- If the camera/compute hardware is weak or locally restricted.

### 5.3 Approach 3: Hybrid (vision + IR)
Many teams (although not always published) combine:
- Vision for context (green, gaps, “distant” line)
- IR for fine control at high frequency

**Trade-off:** more hardware and calibration, but redundancy against failures.

---

## 6) Gaps: how not to lose points for “a 20 cm gap”

**Rule data:** gap ≤ 20 cm and always preceded by ≥5 cm of line.  
Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

### Strategy A (vision): “continuity prediction”
- Detect that the line “disappears” and use the heading estimated by the previous straight line.
- Maintain moderate speed + smooth correction.
- Resume line-following when black reappears.

### Strategy B (IMU/encoders): “maintain heading”
- Freeze the direction setpoint.
- Advance estimated distance (encoders) or calibrated time.
- Rehabilitate sensors upon detecting black.

**Comparison:**
- Vision tends to be more tolerant of small deviations if the FOV captures the re-engagement.
- Encoders are good if the floor is consistent; skidding on ramps can mislead.

---

## 7) Green detection at intersections: the anti-false-positive filter

**Rule data:** greens 25×25 mm; double green = dead end (180° turn).  
Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

### Camera solution (the most scalable)
**Best practice:** *look for green only when there is evidence of an intersection*.  
Example: if the line widens, a “T” appears, or there are multiple black blobs.

This way you avoid:
- detecting green in noise / objects off the track,
- or confusing tones due to lighting.

### Alternative: color sensor close to the floor
Works if:
- the robot passes “close” to the green square,
- and the sensor is well positioned.

It is very simple, but less tolerant of trajectory error.

---

## 8) Traction, ramps, and seesaw: mechanics that show in the score

### 8.1 What the rule requires
- Ramps up to 25°
- Seesaw < 20°
- Speed bumps up to 1 cm

Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

### 8.2 Pattern observed in strong teams
- **4WD** and **soft wheels** (neoprene/silicone).  
  - Airborne: silicone wheels + 4 12V motors.  
  - Overengineering²: neoprene wheels + 4 DC motors.

Sources:  
- Airborne: https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/  
- Overengineering²: https://github.com/Overengineering-squared/Overengineering-squared-RoboCup

### 8.3 Mechanical comparison of alternatives (with “coach” reading)
**2WD + free wheel**
- ✅ simple and lightweight  
- ❌ skids more on ramps and changes support on seesaw  
- ❌ often requires more aggressive corrections → more risk of LOP

**Rigid 4WD**
- ✅ better traction and control  
- ❌ if the chassis is rigid, on irregularities it can “support on 2 wheels” → you lose traction

**4WD + compliance (suspension or flexible chassis + soft wheels)**
- ✅ maximizes traction and stability  
- ✅ reduces vibration (better vision)  
- ❌ more parts and complexity

Airborne publishes passive suspension as an explicit decision.  
Source: https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/

### 8.4 Ramp control (software)
High success rate recommendation:
- Detect ramp by IMU (pitch).
- Switch to “ramp mode”: lower speed + speed control with encoders (if available).
- Avoid sharp turns (skidding).

---

## 9) Sensors: the modern “trident” (Camera + IMU + Distance)

### 9.1 Camera
Used for:
- line, green, gaps
- EZ entrance (silver)
- victims and areas

### 9.2 IMU
Overengineering² uses BNO055; Airborne uses ICM-20948.  
Sources:
- https://github.com/Overengineering-squared/Overengineering-squared-RoboCup  
- https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/

Typical uses:
- maintain heading in gaps
- detect ramps/seesaw (pitch/roll)
- stabilize control against bumps

### 9.3 Distance: ToF vs ultrasound (and why ToF is seen a lot in 2025)
Airborne reports 5× VL53L0X (ToF) + I2C mux.  
Source: https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/

**ToF**
- ✅ accurate at short range, fast, compact  
- ❌ sensitive to black surfaces/absorption and extreme angles  
- ❌ many ToF on I2C → mux

**Ultrasound**
- ✅ cheap and simple  
- ❌ echoes and “ghosts” in small spaces  
- ❌ slower / less deterministic

**Coach tip:** in EZ (walls and objects), ToF tends to give more repeatable behavior.

---

## 10) Entry to the Evacuation Zone: detection of “silver” (and why some use AI)

**Rule data:** EZ entrance marked by silver reflective tape 25×250 mm.  
Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

Airborne reports a dedicated YOLOv8 model to detect that strip.  
Source: https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/

### Compared alternatives
1) Reflective sensor on the floor (threshold)  
   - ✅ simple and fast  
   - ❌ sensitive to light, angle, wear, “false” shines

2) Camera + threshold by brightness/color  
   - ✅ more context  
   - ❌ requires fine calibration and exposure control

3) Camera + ML model (YOLO/segmentation)  
   - ✅ robust if the dataset is good  
   - ❌ requires dataset/training/compute (e.g., Coral)

---

## 11) Victims: detection, classification, and manipulation (the part that multiplies)

### 11.1 What defines alive/dead (rule)
- Alive: silver reflective and **conductive**  
- Dead: black, **non-conductive**  
Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

### 11.2 Victim detection: classical vision vs AI
Overengineering² indicates that they migrated to AI because certain OpenCV techniques (e.g., Hough Circles) were fragile for detection tasks.  
Source: https://github.com/Overengineering-squared/Overengineering-squared-RoboCup

Airborne uses YOLOv8 for victims.  
Source: https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/

**Practical conclusion:** in 2024–2025 the trend is to use ML where OpenCV becomes very dependent on the “ideal case.”

### 11.3 Alive/dead classification: vision vs conductivity vs hybrid
**A) Only vision (color/reflection)**
- ✅ no contact  
- ❌ silver in shadow can look dark; shiny black can mislead

**B) Conductivity**
- ✅ very robust confirmation if contact is good  
- ❌ requires mechanical design (electrodes) and stable reading when grabbing

**C) Hybrid (recommended)**
- Vision for locating/positioning  
- Conductivity to confirm once captured

### 11.4 Rescue mechanism: characteristics of “high % success”
Airborne publishes a rescue arm with dual servo.  
Overengineering² lists high torque servos (up to 35 kg).

Sources:
- https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/  
- https://github.com/Overengineering-squared/Overengineering-squared-RoboCup

**Best practices observed in strong teams:**
- “Funnel” or physical guide that directs the sphere towards the claw.
- Stable fixation (without bouncing) before lifting.
- Deposit with geometry that prevents the ball from bouncing out.

---

## 12) Motors and transmission: why 12V and low RPM appear so much

Airborne reports 4× 12V DC motors 77 RPM.  
Source: https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/

**Reading:** 77 RPM (depending on wheel diameter) offers:
- high torque for ramps,
- controllable speed for following the line and not overshooting greens.

### Alternatives (and how they impact)
- **More RPM:** faster, but harder to control and more skidding on ramps.
- **Less RPM:** more torque, more stable, but can be slow if control is poor.

**Coach tip 2025:** for scoring and penalties, “fast but erratic” tends to lose.

---

## 13) Power: batteries and regulators (what kills runs without you seeing it)

Airborne reports:
- 3S LiPo 2700mAh
- dedicated step-downs (Pololu D24V50F5 / D36V28F5)
- custom PCBs for distribution

Source: https://github.com/JamesBond6873/Airborne_Rescue_Line_2025/

### Compared alternatives
**2S LiPo**
- ✅ simple  
- ❌ for 12V you need boost or different motors

**3S LiPo (very common in “pro”)**
- ✅ powers 12V with margin  
- ✅ buck to 5V for SBC + sensors  
- ❌ requires good distribution design and protections

**Separate rails (logic battery vs motors)**
- ✅ reduces resets due to noise  
- ❌ extra weight and logistics

**Best practices “competition”:**
- Serious buck for 5V from Raspberry + Coral.
- Filtering (capacitance) close to drivers/compute.
- Robust wiring and connectors (no loose protoboard).

---

## 14) Rules 2025: changes and “controversial” points (AI, tools, false victims)

### 14.1 Restriction of “too magical” tools
The rules 2025 includes a section on development tools:
- Own tools or those that do not complete tasks by themselves are allowed.
- Tools not developed by the team that complete tasks and give an advantage without development are prohibited (examples: line-following sensors, AI cameras, OCR libraries).

Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

**Reading:** using a normal camera + custom software is reasonable; using a “commercial module” that already returns “line” as a service may be questionable.

### 14.2 “False victims” and “flashing lights in EZ”
In the text of the rules 2025 reviewed for this study:
- There is no explicit mechanic for “false victims”.
- There is no penalty rule for evacuating false ones (because they are not defined).
- There is no official indication about “flashing lights in the rescue zone” as a scoring element.

This does not rule out that:
- there are **local variants**,  
- or that those changes are being discussed in 2026 (there are 2026 drafts in forums),  
but **it is not part of the final rules 2025** used here.

Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

---

## 15) SuperTeam Challenge: allowed communication and minimum viable design

The rules 2025 clarifies:
- SuperTeam exists as a separate award; it does not affect individual score.
- They recommend carrying wireless communication.
- Communication: **2.4 GHz**, power ≤ **100 mW EIRP**.

Source: Rules 2025: https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueLine2025-final-1.pdf

### Communication alternatives (quick comparison)
- Local Wi‑Fi (AP): high throughput, but possible congestion.
- BLE: simple, limited payload.
- ESP‑NOW: fast, direct, but extra stack.

**Coach recommendation:** simple and robust protocol (handshake + status + short messages), tested in noisy environments.

---

## 16) 2025 Strategy “recipe” (practical and measurable)

### 16.1 Engineering priority (recommended order)
1) Finish linear track with **minimum LOP**.
2) Handle green intersections with a high success rate.
3) Solve ramps and seesaw with stability (no skidding, no tipping).
4) Enter EZ and rescue with a **plan** (vision + distance + mechanism).
5) Optimize speed once success is high.

### 16.2 Quantitative goals (for testing)
- 90–95% success in intersections and dead ends.
- 90% in 20 cm gaps (in variable lighting).
- 80–90% success in pickup and deposit per victim (in a series of 10 attempts).
- 0–1 LOP per complete run (ideal).
